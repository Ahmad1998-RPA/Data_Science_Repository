    "1. Describe how to use the open() and read() Python functions to open and read the contents of a text file.\n",
    "2. Explain how to use the with statement in Python.\n",
    "3. Describe how to use the readline() function in Python.\n",
    "4. Explain how to use the seek() function to read specific character(s) in a text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Introduction\n",
    "Reading text files involves extracting and processing the data stored within them. Text files can have various structures, and how you read them depends on their format. Here's a general guide on reading text files with different structures.\n",

    "\n",
    "   1. File path: The file path parameter consists of the filename and directory where the file is located.\n",
    "   2. Mode: The mode parameter specifies the purpose of opening the file, such as 'r' for reading, 'w' for writing, or 'a' for appending"
