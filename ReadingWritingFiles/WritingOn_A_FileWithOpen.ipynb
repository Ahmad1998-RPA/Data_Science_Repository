    "# Writing to a file\n",
    "You can create a new text file and write data to it using Python's `open()` function. The `open()` function takes two main arguments: the file path (including the file name) and the mode parameter, which specifies the operation you want to perform on the file. For writing, you should use the mode 'w' Here's an example:"
